I would like to thanks a few guys that helps me to build this tool by there active free and open source job :

I based the REST requests module of the Android DataLib on its **Basic HTTP Client library**. This a clear and simple library that helps you to send REST request on your Android project.

You can find the original Basic HTTP Client library here :

I based the Service and multithread backbone of the Android DataLib thanks to an early version of **DataDroid**. This is a library that helps you to implement multithreaded webservices request on your Android project.
